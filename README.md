# Music_Visualizer
mini-project-4-interactive-visualization-sampei-and-sara created by GitHub Classroom

This project is an Interactive Music Visulizer. To use this program, users will run the audio_visualizer.py file, which will play Britney Spear's hit single Inside Out with a visualization of the song. Furthermore, users will be able to press the keys Q, W, and E to manipulate the colors and the four arrows to move around the image.

This project is still in progress towards our MVP: a movie with generative imagery from a single file. The movie behavior is then modified by live keystrokes.
